## Descirption

> The "Cars Detection Project" is a MATLAB project aimed at detecting moving cars in a video, isolating them from the background, and calculating certain region properties related to the detected cars and adding bounding box as to indicated the car detected. The project involves several sections, each addressing a specific aspect of the car detection process.

## MATLAB Toolbox Needed:
### Image Processing Toolbox
* Image Segmenter
* Image Region Analyzer
* Color Thresholder
### Computer Vision Toolbox
* Video Viewer 

# Output
The final output video, "ComparisonRoadTraffic.mp4," presents a captivating display of the original video filtered from noise and the innovative depiction of moving cars with red bounding boxes, providing valuable insights into car movement and enhancing the overall visual experience.
